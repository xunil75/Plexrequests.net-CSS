# Plexrequests.net-CSS
CSS Modification for the Plexrequests.net (https://github.com/tidusjar/PlexRequests.Net)

I wanted to make Plexrequets.net to look like my Plex Mediacenter layout, I decided to teak the Bootstrap css to look like it. Feel free to download it and change it to suit your needs.

**Install:**

Please download both files **bootstrap.css** and **custom.min.css** and replace with the ones located at:

**`/opt/plexrequests/Release/Content`**
